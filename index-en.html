      <h1>Naomi troubleshooting</h1>
      <p>
        This page includes basic strategies for troubleshooting naomi
        errors.  If you search for your error in this page, you should
        hopefully find guidance for the next steps.  If in doubt, please
        contact a facilitator.  This list will grow during the workshop,
        as we find common problems.

      <h2>Data problems</h2>

      <p class = "error">
        The number of people who tested positive is greater than the number of people tested
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>What it means:</i> In one or more rows of the data the value within column <code>ancrt_test_pos</code> is greater than that in <code>ancrt_tested</code> which is not plausible
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>How to fix it:</i> they need to review their data because those values are not plausible - i.e. check for data entry errors, check calculations from previous sources, etc.,
      </p>

      <!-- VALIDATION_ANC_CLIENT_NUMBERS2 -->
      <p class="error">
        The number of people already on ART is greater than the number positive (those known to be positive + those who tested positive)
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>What it means:</i>
        In one or more rows of this data, the number of people on ART (<code>ancrt_already_art</code>) is greater than those HIV positive (<code>ancrt_known_pos</code> + <code>ancrt_test_pos</code>), which is not plausible and cannot be used by Naomi.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>How to fix it:</i>
        Data should be reviewed to identify where these numbers have come from and then be corrected accordingly.
      </p>

      <!-- VALIDATION_UNIQUE_COMBINATIONS -->
      <p class="error">
        Unique combinations are required for columns: X, Y, Z
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>What it means:</i> Duplicated entries have been found,
        i.e. only 1 entry should be present for each unique
        combination of the columns listed in the error message, which
        Naomi cannot accept.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>How to fix it:</i>
        Data should be reviewed to identify which rows have duplicated entries and corrected accordingly.
